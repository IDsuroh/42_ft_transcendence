# Work Log

This file is the running log for work done in this repository.

## Project Snapshot

- Repository: `42_ft_transcendence`
- Stack: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Nginx, Docker Compose
- Main directories:
  - `backend/` for Django app and API
  - `frontend/` for React app
  - `nginx/` for reverse proxy and HTTPS configuration
- Current routing model:
  - Nginx serves the built frontend and proxies `/api/` to Django
  - React Router handles frontend pages like `/signup`, `/login`, `/home`, `/privacy`, and `/terms`

## 2026-07-24

### Task
- Create a dedicated markdown file to track work done in this project

### Actions
- Read the repository structure and identified the main areas: `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `nginx/`
- Reviewed the main project context from `README.md`
- Reviewed service orchestration in `docker-compose.yml`
- Reviewed backend dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt`
- Reviewed frontend dependencies in `frontend/package.json`
- Reviewed Django configuration in `backend/config/settings.py`
- Reviewed frontend routing in `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Reviewed reverse proxy setup in `nginx/default.conf`
- Created this file as the persistent work log for future sessions

### Notes
- The project is set up as a Dockerized full-stack app with Django, PostgreSQL, React, and Nginx
- Authentication and basic policy pages are already described in the repository documentation
- This file can now be appended as we continue working

## 2026-07-24

### Task
- Read `Notes.txt` and align with the current study progress

### Actions
- Reviewed `Notes.txt` in the project root
- Confirmed the repository study plan is organized into six logic flows named A through F
- Noted that steps A and B are complete and the next focus is step C: React frontend startup and routing flow
- Reviewed the step C files:
  - `frontend/src/main.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/App.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/SignupPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/PrivacyPage.jsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/TermsPage.jsx`

### Notes
- Step C starts in `frontend/src/main.jsx`, where React loads and mounts `<App />` into the HTML element with id `root`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` wraps the app in `BrowserRouter`, renders the navigation links, and maps URL paths to page components
- The page files are the route targets that React Router displays after matching the browser URL
- `LoginPage.jsx`, `SignupPage.jsx`, and `HomePage.jsx` also contain request logic, so they belong partly to step D as well
